The Olympics is an international sporting event. Participation in the event has expanded from 241 athletes to 11,500 since the last Olympics. Given the historical data throughout the Olympics, the odds of winning a medal (gold, silver, or bronze) could perhaps be given based on a few biological attributes of the athletes. Therefore, I decided to do exploratory data analysis so I can visualize patterns within the dataset. Furthermore, I wanted to predict if an athlete would win a medal based on those few attributes given. The dataset was provided by the Kaggle under 120 years of Olympic History: Athletes and Results.
