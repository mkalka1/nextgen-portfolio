#### Data Preparation - Climate Change - Historical Average Temperatures and Future Projections
<P>
Data Transformation / Cleansing for Climate Change – Historical Average Temperatures as well as the Average Temperatures – Future Projections was fantastic experience and quite eye opening in many ways, especially the knowledge gained of changing climate over the years and the future projections for the next 100 years.

Climate Change Knowledge Portal was the main data source resides within World Bank Data Catalog. The data was tricky at times as it was available on yearly, monthly as well as based on the range of the years. Below are the three data sources from where the data was acquired:
</P>
<li> Flat File (CSV and Excel) Data Source
<li> Website Data (Data available as part of web pages)
<li> APIs (Data available in JSON format)
<P>
Cleansed / Transformed data in three different datasets (from Flat File, Web and APIs) was then loaded into the SQL Lite database in the form of individual tables, merged into one single dataset. The single dataset was applied by five different visualizations in order to further analyze the data in terms of its readiness and accuracy for further analysis and modeling.
